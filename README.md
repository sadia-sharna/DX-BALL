# DX-BALL
This is a 2D game, developed by C language with Visual Studio 2010 IDE. This game is developed for two levels.
To go through the actual solution file the repository is: 

iGraphic1.2VS10/iGraphic1.2VS10.sln

All the images are in the following directory:

iGraphic1.2VS10/iGraphic1.2VS10

For better visualization of the game I have uploaded a video, which you can find in DX_BALL.webm file.
There is also a zip file of the snaps of two levels.

The features of this game are:

1. Various power-ups appear when hitting random blocks. 

2. Grabbing different 'Fruits' and 'Ftars', the score will be increased in different ratio.

3. Initially there will be 'one' life but grabbing heart, you will get the opportunity to have more lifes.

4. Grabbing 'Danger' will cost you one life.

5. By taking 'Increased paddle' the paddle size will increase and taking 'decreased paddle' opposite incident will occur.

6. By taking 'Shooting' power-up, you will get the chance to brak the bricks by shooting.


There are so many developments need to do with this project. This is a mini DX-Ball project.

Thank you.
